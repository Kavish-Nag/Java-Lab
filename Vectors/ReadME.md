Define a Vector class with one array member of double type.

The constructor of the class should accept an array and should throw a VectorException if the array does not contain 2 or 3 elements strictly. i.e. for all other dimensions than 2D or 3D, the Vector object should not be created.

Define the following methods : Vector add(Vector v1), Vector subtract(Vector v1), double dotProduct(Vector v1), printVector(Vector v1).

Also, define an Exception class VectorException.
